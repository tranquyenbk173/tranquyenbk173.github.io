  abstract={Prior Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) methods often aim to train a domain-invariant feature extractor, which may hinder the model from learning sufficiently discriminative features. To tackle this, a line of works based on prompt learning leverages the power of large-scale pre-trained vision-language models to learn both domain-invariant and specific features through a set of domain-agnostic and domain-specific learnable prompts. Those studies typically enforce invariant constraints on representation, output, or prompt space to learn such prompts. Differently, we cast UDA as a multiple-objective optimization problem in which each objective is represented by a domain loss. Under this new framework, we propose aligning per-objective gradients to foster consensus between them. Additionally, to prevent potential overfitting when fine-tuning this deep learning architecture, we penalize the norm of these gradients. To achieve these goals, we devise a practical gradient update procedure that can work under both single-source and multi-source UDA. Empirically, our method consistently surpasses other prompt-based baselines by a large margin on different UDA benchmarks},

We find that applying human habits of organizing and connecting information can serve as an efficient strategy when training deep learning models. Specifically, by building a hierarchical tree structure based on the expanding set of labels, we gain fresh insights into the data, identifying groups of similar classes could easily cause confusion. Additionally, we delve deeper into the hidden connections between classes by exploring the original pretrained model's behavior through an optimal transport-based approach. From these insights, we propose a novel regularization loss function that encourages models to focus more on challenging knowledge areas, thereby enhancing overall performance.

Compared to training tasks separately, MTL significantly reduces computational costs, improves data efficiency, and potentially enhances model performance by leveraging knowledge across tasks. Hence, it has been adopted in a variety of applications, ranging from computer vision to natural language processing and speech recognition. Among them, there is an emerging line of work in MTL that focuses on manipulating the task gradient to derive an ultimate gradient descent direction to benefit all tasks. Despite achieving impressive results on many benchmarks, directly applying these approaches without using appropriate regularization techniques might lead to suboptimal solutions on real-world problems. In particular, standard training that minimizes the empirical loss on the training data can easily suffer from overfitting to low-resource tasks or be spoiled by noisy-labeled ones, which can cause negative transfer between tasks and overall performance drop. To alleviate such problems, we propose to leverage a recently introduced training method, named Sharpness-aware Minimization, which can enhance model generalization ability on single-task learning. Accordingly, we present a novel MTL training methodology, encouraging the model to find task-based flat minima for coherently improving its generalization capability on all tasks.

In another aspect, Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML) is a framework designed to improve the adaptability of models. MAML optimizes a set of meta-models that are specifically tailored for quick adaptation to multiple tasks with minimal fine-tuning steps and can generalize well with limited data. In this work, we explore the connection between SAM and MAML, particularly in terms of enhancing model generalization. We introduce Agnostic-SAM, a novel approach that combines the principles of both SAM and MAML. Agnostic-SAM adapts the core idea of SAM by optimizing the model towards wider local minima using training data, while concurrently maintaining low loss values on validation data. By doing so, it seeks flatter minima that are not only robust to small perturbations but also less vulnerable to data distributional shift problems. Our experimental results demonstrate that Agnostic-SAM significantly improves generalization over baselines across a range of datasets and under challenging conditions such as noisy labels and data limitation.}

However, traditional networks like ViTs and CNNs return different results when processing original data versus its encrypted form, meaning that they require data to be decrypted, posing a security risk by exposing sensitive information. One solution for this issue is using polynomial networks, including state-of-the-art Multilinear Operator Networks, which return the same outputs given the real data and their encrypted forms under Leveled Fully Homomorphic Encryption. Nevertheless, these models are susceptible to catastrophic forgetting in incremental learning settings. Thus this paper will present a new low-rank adaptation method combined with the Gradient Projection Memory mechanism to minimize the issue. Our proposal is compatible with Leveled Fully Homomorphic Encryption while achieving a sharp improvement in performance compared to existing models.}

  abstract={Recent research has shown that Random Projection (RP) can effectively improve the performance of pre-trained models in Continual learning (CL). The authors hypothesized that using RP to map features onto a higher-dimensional space can make them more linearly separable. In this work, we theoretically analyze the role of RP and present its benefits for improving the modelâ€™s generalization ability in each task and facilitating CL overall. Additionally, we take this result to the next level by proposing a Multi-View Random Projection scheme for a stronger ensemble classifier. In particular, we train a set of linear experts, among which diversity is encouraged based on the principle of AdaBoost, which was initially very challenging to apply to CL. Moreover, we employ a task-based adaptive backbone with distinct prompts dedicated to each task for better representation learning. To properly select these task-specific components and mitigate potential feature shifts caused by misprediction, we introduce a simple yet effective technique called the self-improvement process.

  abstract={Prompt-based techniques, such as prompt-tuning and prefix-tuning, have gained prominence for their efficiency in fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Despite their widespread adoption, the theoretical foundations of these methods remain limited. For instance, in prefix-tuning, we observe that a key factor in achieving performance parity with full fine-tuning lies in the reparameterization strategy. However, the theoretical principles underpinning the effectiveness of this approach have yet to be thoroughly examined. Our study demonstrates that reparameterization is not merely an engineering trick but is grounded in deep theoretical foundations. Specifically, we show that the reparameterization strategy implicitly encodes a shared structure between prefix key and value vectors. Building on recent insights into the connection between prefix-tuning and mixture of experts models, we further illustrate that this shared structure significantly improves sample efficiency in parameter estimation compared to non-shared alternatives. The effectiveness of prefix-tuning across diverse tasks is empirically confirmed to be enhanced by the shared structure, through extensive experiments in both visual and language domains. Additionally, we uncover similar structural benefits in prompt-tuning, offering new perspectives on its success. Our findings provide theoretical and empirical contributions, advancing the understanding of prompt-based methods and their underlying mechanisms.}
