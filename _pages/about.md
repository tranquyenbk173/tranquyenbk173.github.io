My name is Quyen Tran, I am Research Resident at [VinAI Research](https://www.vinai.io/), where I am very fortunate to be advised by Professors [Trung Le](https://research.monash.edu/en/persons/trung-le), [Dinh Phung](https://dinhphung.ml/), [Nhat Ho](https://nhatptnk8912.github.io/) and [Thien Nguyen](https://ix.cs.uoregon.edu/~thien/) (random order).

My research focuses primarily on *Continual Learning, Transfer Learning, and Robust Machine Learning*, with the aim of developing **truly intelligent and reliable systems** that can operate effectively under control and support human life.

<!-- Before that, I graduated from [Hanoi University of Science & Technology (HUST)](https://www.hust.edu.vn/) with an excellent Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. During my time here, I was a research student at [Data Science Laboratory](http://ds.soict.hust.edu.vn/), advised by Dr.[Linh Ngo](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/linhnv/) and Professor [Khoat Than](https://users.soict.hust.edu.vn/khoattq/). -->
